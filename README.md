# MyWorkCam

Do you forget what you have worked today or yesterday? Don't do it anymore.

MyWorkCam periodically captures your desktop images and stores them to your folder. 
You can recall what you have worked today or days ago by reviewing your screen shots.

Don't worry. MyWorkCam never sends your files to others.

# How to use

Run and find the tray icon, then right click on it and update your preferences.

Open the screen shot folder you have specified and recall what you have done so far. Delete them after checking them out, if you wish.
