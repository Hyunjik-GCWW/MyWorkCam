# MyWorkCam

Do you forget what you have worked today or yesterday? Don't do it anymore.

MyWorkCam periodically captures your desktop images and stores them to your folder. 
You can recall what you have worked today or days ago by reviewing your screen shots.

Don't worry. MyWorkCam never sends your files to others.

# Why this is better for recalling your works

Your screen shot is stored in separated folder daily. For example, 

```
John/Documents/MyWorkCam screenshots/2016-10-01/Screenshot-23-49-01.png
John/Documents/MyWorkCam screenshots/2016-10-01/Screenshot-23-59-01.png
John/Documents/MyWorkCam screenshots/2016-10-02/Screenshot-00-09-01.png
John/Documents/MyWorkCam screenshots/2016-10-02/Screenshot-00-19-01.png
```
So you can see the grouped screen shots day by day.

While you are away and the desktop is Locked or logged off from Remote Desktop, MyWorkCam will not capture the screen. You don't have to delete a lot of black screenshot images.

# How to use

[Download](https://github.com/Nettention/MyWorkCam/files/503544/MyWorkCam.zip) and unzip the file.

Run MyWorkCam.exe and find the tray icon, then right click on it and update your preferences.

Open the screen shot folder you have specified and recall what you have done so far. Delete them after checking them out, if you wish.

If you want it to run automatically on Windows logon, open "shell:startup" on Command Line and add the Shortcut of MyWorkCam.exe.

# Issues 

For now, your screen shot will be stored in a folder in your Document folder. It cannot be changed. I will fix it later.
For now, the period for screen shot is 10 minutes. It cannot be changed. I will fix it later.
